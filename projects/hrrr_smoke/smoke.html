            <p>
                During my M.S. at UC Berkeley in 2018-2019, the Camp Fire that
                destroyed Paradise, CA resulted in a pall of smoke that lingered
                over the Bay Area for almost 2 weeks. As someone from the East
                Coast, I was astonished by the scale and impact of the smoke. We
                wore N95 masks for the majority of the event (an unusual accessory
                prior to the pandemic), and tried to avoid exerting ourselves
                outdoors. At night, shining a flashlight would illuminate the
                smoke particles suspended in the air like a bad crime drama.
            </p>

                After the Camp Fire, I helped work on a scientific publication
                that investigated the added value of using low cost air quality
                sensors (specifically PurpleAir) to validate the NOAA HRRR-Smoke
                model. This model is a coupling of the Weather Research and
                Forecasting model (WRF) with a smoke plume model that uses
                satellite observations of fire radiative power to estimate the
                smoke output. Then the plume is transported with the prevailing
                winds and atmospheric conditions.
